# Instructions

put your fabm models here, unders some subdiretory of your choice. 

We would have (temporarily) the tame_model_library.f90 here.

- All of the models could have use fabm_types, tame_types, tame_model_library
- 


# Naming schemes

- All variables should have short names (think of nut)
- we have the 'dissolved' and 'particulate' state. 
- Non-living things may be simpler.

# Basic tame_types

type_dissolved (already a fabm property)

type_inorganic
type_organic

# Material
- composition, size, other traits

- composed of OM and IM (with each respective different traits)
- OM as DOM and POM,  IM as PIM and DIM
